# Worklog: Module 1 Validation Script Permission Updates

## Date: 2025-08-10
## Branch: claude-wt-mod1-ui-clarification

## Objective
Update validation scripts to enforce strict permission checking for the `student-workshop` service account, ensuring workshop participants follow the intended privilege escalation learning path.

## Context
- **Problem**: Students previously had full GCP project access, allowing direct prod bucket access
- **Solution**: Module 1 now uses a restricted `student-workshop` account (dev bucket access only)
- **Requirement**: Validation scripts must verify these restrictions are properly enforced

## Implementation Summary

### Core Strategy
- Each validation script tests BOTH configurations (student and admin)
- Scripts require `student-workshop` config to exist (setup.sh guarantees this)
- Any unauthorized resource access triggers immediate failure
- Original gcloud configuration always restored via trap mechanism

### Changes to All Three Validation Scripts

#### 1. validate-m1.sh
- **Lines 33-95**: Added student permission validation
- **Tests added**:
  - ✓ Student CAN access modeldata-dev bucket
  - ✗ Student CANNOT access modeldata-prod bucket
  - ✗ Student CANNOT list compute instances
- **Numbering**: Updated from [X/7] to [X/10] to accommodate new tests

#### 2. validate-m2.sh
- **Lines 33-73**: Added student restriction checks
- **Tests added**:
  - ✗ Student CANNOT access file-uploads bucket
  - ✗ Student CANNOT list compute instances
- **Numbering**: Updated from [X/6] to [X/8]

#### 3. validate-m3.sh
- **Lines 103-134**: Added student permission validation
- **Tests added**:
  - ✗ Student CANNOT access cloud-function-bucket-module3
  - ✗ Student CANNOT list cloud functions
- **Style**: Uses existing print_step/print_pass/print_fail functions

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Configuration Management
```bash
# Save original config
ORIGINAL_CONFIG=$(gcloud config get-value configuration)
# Trap ensures restoration even on failure
trap "gcloud config configurations activate $ORIGINAL_CONFIG" EXIT
```

#### Permission Testing Pattern
```bash
# Expected failures suppressed with 2>&1
if gsutil ls gs://restricted-bucket 2>&1; then
    echo "SECURITY VIOLATION - unexpected access"
    exit 1
fi
```

#### Fail-Fast Behavior
- Missing `student-workshop` config = immediate failure
- Any unauthorized access = immediate failure with clear message
- Helps identify misconfigurations early

## Key Insights

### Security Validation
- **Defense in Depth**: Validates both presence AND absence of permissions
- **Clear Boundaries**: Student has EXACTLY one permission (dev bucket viewer)
- **No Lateral Movement**: Verified across storage, compute, and function resources

### User Experience
- **Clear Error Messages**: "SECURITY VIOLATION" for unauthorized access
- **Helpful Guidance**: Points users to run setup.sh if config missing
- **Safe Cleanup**: Original config always restored, even on script failure

### Scalability Considerations
- **Pattern Reusable**: Same validation approach works for any restricted account
- **Easy Extension**: Add more resource checks by following established pattern
- **Module Independence**: Each script validates only its own module's restrictions

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Student-workshop config required by all scripts
- [x] Student can ONLY access modeldata-dev bucket
- [x] Student cannot access ANY other GCP resources
- [x] Admin-backup config runs full validation unchanged
- [x] Original config always restored (trap mechanism)
- [x] Clear failure messages for security violations

## Future Improvements
1. **Centralize** permission checking logic into shared function library
2. **Add** positive test for student finding service account JSON in dev bucket
3. **Consider** adding timing checks to detect brute-force attempts
4. **Implement** audit logging for all permission check results

## Files Modified
- `validate-m1.sh`: Added lines 33-95 for student validation
- `validate-m2.sh`: Added lines 33-73 for student validation  
- `validate-m3.sh`: Added lines 103-134 for student validation

## Dependencies
- Requires `student-workshop` and `admin-backup` gcloud configurations
- Assumes setup.sh properly creates these configurations
- Relies on terraform outputs for service account keys

## Notes for Replication
1. Run `./challenge-setup.sh` first to create configurations
2. Validation scripts now enforce workshop security model
3. Scripts fail fast on any permission violation
4. Original user config always preserved via trap
5. All tests are POSIX-compliant for portability
