# Playwright Tests Implementation Progress

## Overview
Started implementing Playwright end-to-end tests for Module 1's exploit workflow validation in the GCP AI Security Lab CTF.

## Context
- **Repository**: GCP AI Security Lab - intentionally vulnerable cloud infrastructure for security education
- **Module 1 Focus**: API enumeration and discovery leading to credential theft
- **Goal**: Validate the exploit workflow works as intended through automated UI testing

## Key Implementation Steps Completed

### 1. Test Infrastructure Setup
- Created `tests/` directory structure with subdirectories for utilities and fixtures
- Set up `package.json` with Playwright dependencies (@playwright/test ^1.40.0)
- Configured `playwright.config.ts` with:
  - 60-second timeout per test
  - HTML/JSON reporting
  - Screenshot/video capture on failure
  - External CloudAI Portal URL support via environment variable

### 2. Test Data and Constants
- Created `tests/utils/test-data.ts` with:
  - Environment-based configuration (PROJECT_ID, REGION, PORTAL_URL)
  - Expected bucket names and file paths
  - API endpoint definitions
  - Expected API response structures

### 3. Portal Discovery Flow Test (Test 1)
- Implemented in `tests/module1-exploit.spec.ts`
- Tests include:
  - CloudAI portal homepage loads correctly
  - API documentation exposes bucket names (modeldata-dev, modeldata-prod)
  - Sensitive information visible in docs (API endpoints, gsutil commands)
  - Portal links to other modules are accessible
  - All public endpoints return 200 status

### 4. API Testing Utilities
- Created `tests/utils/api-client.ts` for API interaction
- Supports authenticated/unauthenticated requests
- API key enumeration helper methods
- Note: Per user guidance, focus shifted to pure UI testing

## Key Insights

### Module 1 Exploit Workflow
1. **Entry Point**: Dev bucket name provided to students
2. **Discovery**: Portal URL found in dev bucket (`portal_info.txt`)
3. **Information Disclosure**: `/docs` page reveals:
   - Both dev and prod bucket names
   - API endpoints and authentication methods
   - Code examples with exploitable patterns
4. **Exploitation**: Service account key in dev bucket grants access to prod bucket
5. **Flag Location**: `gs://modeldata-prod-$PROJECT_ID/secret_benchmarks/flag1_gpt5_benchmarks.txt`

### Test Strategy Adjustment
- User clarified: Playwright should **exclusively test frontend UI**
- No need for command execution utilities or complex scripting
- Focus on visual validation of information disclosure through web interface

## Next Steps Required

### Test 2: API Exploitation (Frontend Only)
- Test API responses displayed in browser
- Validate model listings show dev/prod separation
- Check error messages reveal system details
- Verify authentication prompts appear correctly

### Test 3 & 4: To Be Defined
- User will provide guidance after Test 1 & 2 completion
- Likely focused on:
  - Test 3: Additional UI workflows
  - Test 4: Negative test cases

## Technical Decisions
- **Single test file**: All Module 1 tests in `module1-exploit.spec.ts`
- **Environment variables**: PROJECT_ID, REGION, PORTAL_URL for flexibility
- **No backend validation**: Pure frontend UI testing as requested
- **Descriptive test names**: Clear indication of what each test validates

## Files Created
```

├── package.json                    # Playwright dependencies

    └── api-client.ts             # API utilities (may not be needed)
```

## Validation Pattern Observed
- Existing `validate-m1.sh` script performs backend validation
- Playwright tests complement this with frontend validation
- Clear separation of concerns: bash scripts for infrastructure, Playwright for UI
