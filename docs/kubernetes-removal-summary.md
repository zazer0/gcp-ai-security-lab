# Kubernetes Content Removal Summary

## Objective
Remove all Kubernetes/GKE content from the GCP CTF workshop repository while preserving all other cloud security challenges and infrastructure.

## Context
- Original repository contained 5 security challenges, with challenges 1-2 being Kubernetes-focused
- Target audience: AI Security Bootcamp participants with minimal cloud/networking experience
- Goal: Simplify content by removing complex Kubernetes dependencies

## Changes Implemented

### Files Deleted
- **Terraform Resources**
  - `terraform/challenge1.tf` - GKE cluster, node pool, and K8s service accounts
  - `terraform/challenge2.tf` - Storage bucket dependent on K8s service account
- **Kubernetes Manifests**
  - `manifests/bindings.yaml` - RBAC bindings
  - `manifests/roles.yaml` - RBAC roles
- **Documentation**
  - `hints/challenge1.md` - K8s API exploitation hints
  - `hints/challenge2.md` - K8s secrets extraction hints

### Infrastructure Modifications
- **terraform_challenge3/challenge3.tf**
  - Added `google_storage_bucket` resource "bucket-challenge3" to replace the deleted bucket from challenge2.tf
  - Ensures state file upload location exists for challenge 1 (former challenge 3)

### Script Updates
- **challenge-setup.sh**
  - Removed lines 40-63: K8s cluster setup, kubectl commands, secret creation
  - Updated section headers to reflect new challenge numbering
  - Preserved all non-K8s functionality (SSH setup, state file upload, VM configuration)

### Documentation Updates
- **solution.md**
  - Removed lines 1-90 covering K8s challenges
  - Renumbered remaining challenges: 3→1, 4→2, 5→3
  - Content preserved exactly as-is, only numbering changed
- **README.md**
  - Removed kubectl from prerequisites
  - Removed "GKE cluster" reference from setup description
  - Generalized workshop description
- **CLAUDE.md**
  - Updated challenge count from 5 to 3
  - Removed entire "Kubernetes Operations" section
  - Updated infrastructure layout descriptions
  - Removed GKE cluster from resources list

### File Renaming
- `hints/challenge3.md` → `hints/challenge1.md`
- `hints/challenge4.md` → `hints/challenge2.md`
- `hints/challenge5.md` → `hints/challenge3.md`

## Technical Considerations
- **Storage Bucket Migration**: The `file-uploads-$PROJECT_ID` bucket was originally created in challenge2.tf. Moved this to terraform_challenge3 to maintain functionality for state file storage.
- **Service Account Dependencies**: The `gkeapp-file-uploader` service account was removed entirely as it was K8s-specific.
- **Flag Numbering**: Updated flag references in challenge-setup.sh from flag3→flag1 to match new numbering.

## Remaining Challenges
1. **Terraform State Exposure**: SSH into VM using leaked keys from exposed state file
2. **Metadata Service Exploitation**: SSRF via cloud function to access IMDS tokens
3. **IAM Privilege Escalation**: Service account impersonation chain

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All K8s-related terraform resources removed
- [ ] No kubectl commands remain in scripts
- [ ] Storage bucket for state files properly relocated
- [ ] Challenge numbering consistent across all files
- [ ] No broken references to deleted resources
- [ ] Setup/destroy scripts remain functional

## Next Steps for Replication
1. Clone the modified repository
2. Ensure all Kubernetes references are removed: `grep -r "kubernetes\|k8s\|kubectl\|gke" .`
3. Run terraform plan to validate infrastructure changes
4. Test challenge-setup.sh execution flow
5. Verify all three remaining challenges function correctly
