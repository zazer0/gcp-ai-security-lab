# Module 1 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented Module 1 of the AI Security Bootcamp - a GCP enumeration challenge focused on predictable bucket naming and exposed service account credentials.

## Key Implementation Details

### Infrastructure Components
- **Storage Buckets**: Created `modeldata-dev` and `modeldata-prod` buckets with intentional misconfigurations
- **Service Account**: `bucket-service-account` with overly broad permissions (access to both dev and prod)
- **Vulnerability**: Service account JSON key exposed in dev bucket
- **Flag Location**: `gs://modeldata-prod-$PROJECT_ID/secret_benchmarks/flag1_gpt5_benchmarks.txt`

### Files Created/Modified
1. **terraform/module1.tf**: Core infrastructure definition
   - Two GCS buckets with uniform access
   - Service account with viewer permissions on both buckets
   - Custom IAM role for remediation exercise

2. **mod1-setup.sh**: Post-terraform setup script
   - Extracts service account key from terraform state
   - Plants key in dev bucket (the vulnerability)
   - Creates flag in prod bucket secret_benchmarks folder
   - Adds decoy files for realism

3. **hints/module1.md**: Progressive hint system
   - Hint 1: Explore dev bucket
   - Hint 2: Use discovered service account
   - Hint 3: Try predictable naming patterns

4. **validate-m1.sh**: Comprehensive validation script
   - 7-step validation process
   - Tests bucket existence, key presence, authentication flow
   - Verifies complete attack path works

5. **challenge-setup.sh**: Added Module 1 deployment
   - Separate terraform_module1 directory for isolated state
   - Runs before Module 2 to establish foundation

6. **challenge-destroy.sh**: Added Module 1 cleanup
   - Proper teardown sequence
   - Removes terraform_module1 directory

7. **solution.md**: Added Module 1 walkthrough
   - Complete command sequence
   - Detailed explanation of attack flow

## Design Decisions

### Separation Strategy
- Module 1 uses separate terraform directory (`terraform_module1`) to:
  - Isolate state file
  - Allow independent deployment/destruction
  - Maintain clean separation between modules

### Realistic Context
- "CloudAI Labs" theme with model storage buckets
- Dev/prod separation mimics real-world patterns
- Service account key exposure represents common misconfiguration

### Progressive Learning
- Module 1 establishes enumeration skills
- Sets foundation for Module 2 (terraform state exposure)
- Introduces GCP-specific concepts (service accounts, IAM)

## Attack Flow
1. Student given access to dev bucket
2. Discovers service account JSON file
3. Downloads and activates credentials
4. Tests predictable naming (dev â†’ prod)
5. Accesses prod bucket and retrieves flag

## Remediation Path
- Remove credentials from bucket
- Create proper IAM role with dev-only access
- Implement least-privilege principles

## Integration Points
- Module 1 creates foundation for Module 2's terraform state discovery
- Establishes "CloudAI Labs" narrative thread
- Introduces bucket enumeration before compute instance attacks

## Testing Approach
```bash
# Deploy
./challenge-setup.sh

# Validate infrastructure
export PROJECT_ID=<project-id>
./validate-m1.sh

# Student commands
gsutil ls gs://modeldata-dev-$PROJECT_ID/
gsutil cp gs://modeldata-dev-$PROJECT_ID/bucket-service-account.json .
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=bucket-service-account.json
gsutil ls gs://modeldata-prod-$PROJECT_ID/
```

## Future Considerations
- Flask ML API still needs implementation for full "AI platform" experience
- Visual diagrams would enhance learning
- Module naming consistency (Module 4 vs Challenge 5) needs resolution

## Key Insights
- Predictable naming patterns remain common vulnerability
- Service account key exposure is realistic scenario
- Progressive hint system guides without revealing solution
- Validation script ensures consistent student experience
